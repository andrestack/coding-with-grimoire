# The Road to Full Stack in the age of Bots and Humans 🤖 🙍

I started to learn how to code at the age of 40, at the age of bots and LLM that spit the code in front of you! I shall not be tamed by the laziness, but instead will use it to my benefit. 
Therefore I shall commit to the following:

* Use the custom GPT Grimoire and follow his wizardly bidding 🪄
* Try first and ask later 🤔
* Only proceed after understanding what the code is doing 😻
* Use explanations to 5 year old whenever needed 👶
* Implement learned content in other projects whenever possible ♻️
* Document my journey as much as I can ✍️
